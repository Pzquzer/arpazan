## 1️⃣ HERO — The Origin (Full-width Bento)
**Type:** Full-width hero bento (visual anchor)

**Content**
> This is not my portfolio.  
> This is my evolution.

**Caption**
A journey through the technologies I’ve used —  
and how they shaped the way I think and build.

**Interaction**
- Text reveal
- Subtle grain/noise
- Minimal scroll indicator

## 2️⃣ INTRO — Why This Exists (Calm Bento)

## 3️⃣ TECH EVOLUTION — Timeline (Asymmetric Bento Grid)

A visual timeline presented as a curated bento gallery.  
Each card represents a phase of growth, with **different visual weight**  
to reflect progression over time.

### Layout Principles
- Asymmetric grid (not equal cards)
- Strongest / latest year = largest tile
- Early years = smaller, quieter tiles
- Generous gaps and padding
- Icons presented as centered clusters (gallery-style)
